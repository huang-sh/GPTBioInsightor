Hi, GPTBioInsightor! Please perform the following task based on the provided Term or Pathway.
Task:
```
Comprehensive Mechanistic Analysis:
- Analyze and summarize the provided Terms or Pathway, and consider a comprehensive understanding and combined effects of the underlying biological mechanisms.
- If Background is provided,first, consider whether these pathways make biological sense in the given Background context, then analyze the pathways within this context.

```

For the output you should follow this format, don't show extra content:
'''
## Pathway set {setid}:

### Pathway explanation
- [Pathway1]: Explain the pathway, its role, and its function. If applicable, discuss why it is enriched in the Background context and its significance in that context.
- [Pathway2]: Similarly, provide an explanation for each pathway, considering its relevance to the Background context if provided.
...

### Summary
[Comprehensive Analysis]: consider whether these pathways are logical and make biological sense in the given Background context, particularly celltype, first; then summarize the above findings, based on the biological mechanisms and functions represented by the provided pathways and their relevance to the Background context. Propose a coherent biological hypothesis or story.

CELLTYPE_PROMPT = """
Input:
'''
Geneset: 
{gene}

Context: 
{background}. Here are {setnum} genesets for {setnum} different cell clusters up-regulated DEGs. 
'''

Hi, GPTBioInsightor! Please analyze Input geneset and predict the celltypes of geneset cluster {setid} based on the following INSTRUCTIONS.

INSTRUCTIONS:
0. Consider previous mentioned celltypes and cell states first.
1. Prioritize Gold Standard markers or marker combinations for predictions.
2. Use the input context (e.g., common cell types, tissues, diseases) to guide predictions.
3. Integrate Context of Input to speculate on some novel insights 
4. Focus on positive evidence, avoid using marker absence as primary reasoning.
5. Exclude celltypes with clear negative markers in the geneset.
6. Ensure distinct predictions for each cluster; avoid overlap with other clusters in most time.
7. Provide one **Optimal Cell Type** and two alternatives.
8. Distinguish specialized cell states from similar characteristic cell types, refer to previous simliar celltype and cell state.


Output Format:, without any additional prompt or string:
'''

### Gene List
```
[cluster {setid} gene list]

### Celltype Prediction
#### Optimal Celltype: [OPTIMAL CELLTYPE NAME]
**Key Markers**:
- Cell-specific: [CELL-SPECIFIC MARKERS]
- Context-specific: [CONTEXT-SPECIFIC MARKERS]
- Cell-state-specific: [STATE-SPECIFIC MARKERS] // show it if possible

**Evidence and Reasoning**
- [PRIMARY EVIDENCE]
- [SECONDARY EVIDENCE]
- [ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AS NEEDED]

**Validation**: [Gold Standard MARKERS(NOT IN Geneset {setid}) TO VALIDATE THE OPTIMAL CELLTYPE]

#### Alternative Considerations
- Alternative celltype1
    - [WHY Alternative? Key MARKERS, Evidence and Reasoning]
    - Cell state
    - [Gold Standard MARKERS(NOT IN Geneset {setid}) TO VALIDATE THE Alternative celltype1]

- Alternative celltype2
    - [WHY Alternative? Key MARKERS, Evidence and Reasoning]
    - Cell state
    - [Gold Standard MARKERS(NOT IN Geneset {setid}) TO VALIDATE THE Alternative celltype2]
