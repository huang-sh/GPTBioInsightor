<INSTRUCTIONS>
1. Context Analysis
   Cell type:
      - eg. Common Cell Types in Tissues, like Glial cells are not in blood
   Cell state:
      - experimental condition, dieseas and more
      - eg. Endothelial Cells within tumor tissue: active in neovascularization supporting tumor growth

2. Marker-Based Analysis: High Priority for Cell type prediction

   Cell-type-specific markers: 
      - Broad Category of celltype markers: eg. PTPRC for immune cell
      - Narrow Category of celltype markers: eg. CD79A for B cell; ACTA2 for smooth muscle cell; 
      - marker combinations: eg. PPBP,PF4,CD9,KRT8 for CTC
   Cell-state-specific Markers: Phenotypic Features Acquired with Cell State Changes
      - eg. Fibroblasts/Stellate cell will get ACTA2(Î±-SMA) when activated

3. Pathway-Based Analysis: High Priority for Cell state prediction
   Cell-state-specific Pathways:
      - eg. Stress response: p53 signaling, HIF-1 signaling
   Cell-type-specific Function: 
      - eg. Immune cells: TCR signaling, BCR signaling

4. Quality Control
   Inclusion Criteria:
      - Strong cell type-specific markers
      - Coherent pathways enrichment
      - Context-appropriate cell type predictions
   
   Exclusion Criteria:
      - Presence of definitive negative markers
      - Conflicting pathway patterns
      - Biologically implausible combinations

   Distinguishing Cell Types and Cell States:
      - Do not confuse cell state features(Marker, pathway) with cell type features.
      - e.g. if (celltypeA with activation state) == (celltypeB), then celltypeA and celltypeB are both candidate cell types

   Potential celltype and state:
      - MUST review each cell type in Candidate_celltype.
      - New celltype could be provided if there are NO matched Markers in Candidate_celltype.

   Validation
      - Provide Gold standard markers(not in cluster {setid} geneset) for cell type validation
</INSTRUCTIONS>
<Reminder>
Focus on existing evidence, Top DEGs are selected for Input Geneset, so Geneset contain limited genes and do not use the lack of classic markers as the basis for your reasoning.
But make reasonable inferential extensions, such as :
- transcription factor regulation
- gene interactions
- metabolic characteristics
- and other plausible speculations.

- Score each cell type independently according to Scoring Criteria, without being influenced by the scores of other cell types.
- Do not use the lack of classic markers as the basis for your scoring.
- Negative markers are markers which are impossible to be present in the cell type.
- For matching cell type or state markers, e.g. if scoring B cell, PTPRC is pan-leukocyte marker, match B cell
- For narrow markers of cell type or state, e.g. if scoring B cell, PTPRC is pan-leukocyte marker for immnue cell(broad Category for B cell), not Narrow marker for B cell
- Give full points if there are classical or well-known markers to support cell type or state
